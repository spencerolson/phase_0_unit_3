### Reflection

Before doing this challenge, I'd never used SQL. I think this challenge was a good starting point. I had to do a moderate amount of research on the side while going through the exercises, and after finishing the challenge I now feel I have a very basic grasp of Select statements. I liked learning about the JOIN command; it's pretty neat how you can 'link up' multiple tables so long as they share a common column. I also liked learning about the concept of a unique key that each table must have. I struggled with the GROUP By and HAVING commands, but after doing some research I feel I've got a basic sense of how they work.
