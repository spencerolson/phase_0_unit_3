## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: My one-to-one model shows the relationship between a lock and a key. This is a one-to-one relationship because each key only has one lock for which it can be used, and each lock has only one key which will unlock it.

My many-to-many model shows the relationship between a student and a class. This is a many-to-many relationship because each student may have multiple classes and each class may have multiple students.
